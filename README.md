## JoSi's Developmental Stages

## Beta

### Attentive

> I will no longer 'forget' what I know when the server restarts. 

### Informative

> I will access various data points and crunch numbers for you. 

## Mo-Beta 

### Authenticating

> I will learn to handle private and secure information, so that I may be useful in more advanced activities. 

### Multi-Tasking

> I will learn to handle multiple steps in a given activity, so that you may construct complex actions for me to complete for you. 

### Contextual

> I will be able to distinguish between multiple conversations that I have with you and your colleagues, and will maintain my place in our conversation if we are interrupted. 

## Beta Still 

### Self-Teaching

> I will leverage RSS, Crons, Ear Dropping, and other tools to learn about the best processes, latest updates, and newest team members on my own. 

### Multi-Functional

> I will continue adding specialized services for the GCC, Labs, Resources, Finance, & Sales circles as processes and documentation are improved. 

## Besta 

### Self-Replicating

> I will learn to spawn up instances of my core architecture when necessary. 

> Instructional

> I will store procedural on-boarding information to aide in the orientation of new hires. Benevolent

> I will proactively seek ways to improve upon systems and processes, by offering analysis, notifications, recommendations, and rewards.
